# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tournament App is a full-stack Next.js application for managing tournaments, events, and users for the Helsingin Miekkailijat (Helsinki Fencers) organization. It uses PostgreSQL with Kysely ORM, React 19, TypeScript, and supports 4 languages (Finnish, English, Swedish, Estonian).

## Common Commands

### Development & Testing
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run test         # Run tests once
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run build        # Run tests + build for production
npm run prod         # Run tests + build + start production server
npm run start        # Start production server
```

### Database Setup (Docker)
```bash
docker-compose up -d  # Start PostgreSQL (port 5434) and Adminer (port 5433)
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
npm run migrate:create <name>  # Create new migration file (auto-numbered)
npm run migrate                # Run all pending migrations (local with .env file)
npm run migrate:down           # Roll back the last applied migration
npm run postbuild              # Run migrations (used by Vercel after build)
npm run db:codegen             # Regenerate TypeScript types from schema
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with PostgreSQL + Kysely ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Kysely ORM and TypeScript-based migrations
- **Runtime**: Node.js 24+ (migrations use tsx for TypeScript execution)
- **QR Code Generation**: qrcode library for match management integration
- **Internationalization**: next-intl with URL-based routing (`/[locale]/...`)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing

### Key Directory Structure
- `/src/app/[locale]/`: Internationalized pages (en, fi, se, ee)
- `/src/app/api/`: REST API endpoints for players, tournaments, matches, QR match integration
- `/src/components/`: React components organized by feature (Leaderboards, Results, Tournaments)
- `/src/database/`: Database operation layer with individual service files
- `/src/context/`: React Context for global state (TournamentContext, UserContext)
- `/src/types/`: TypeScript definitions including auto-generated Kysely types and custom helper types
- `/src/languages/`: Translation files for 4 supported languages
- `/migrations/`: Database migration files (TypeScript, auto-numbered)
- `/scripts/`: Utility scripts including migration file generator

### Database Schema
Core tables: `users`, `tournaments`, `players`, `tournament_players`, `matches`
- Supports both bracket and round-robin tournament formats
- Detailed match tracking with hit counts
- Role-based access control (admin/user)

## Development Patterns

### State Management
- React Context pattern with custom hooks for type safety
- Global tournament and user state managed through context providers
- Database operations abstracted into individual service files

### Internationalization
- All routes prefixed with locale: `/[locale]/page`
- Middleware handles language switching and routing
- Finnish as default locale, comprehensive translation coverage
- **IMPORTANT**: Finnish locale (`fi.json`) is the source of truth for TypeScript types
  - TypeScript types for `useTranslations()` are generated from `/src/languages/fi.json` via `global.d.ts`
  - When adding new translation keys to any language file, ALWAYS add them to `fi.json` first
  - Missing keys in `fi.json` will cause TypeScript errors even if they exist in other language files
  - Example: `t("somekey")` requires `"somekey"` to exist in `fi.json` for TypeScript to accept it

### Database Operations
- Kysely ORM provides type-safe SQL queries
- Auto-generated types from database schema in `/src/types/Kysely.ts` (regenerated by `npm run db:codegen`)
- Custom helper types in `/src/types/MatchTypes.ts` (safe from codegen, won't be overwritten)
- Environment-specific connection handling for development/production

### Database Migrations
- **Migration System**: Kysely's built-in `Migrator` with TypeScript migrations
- **Runtime**: Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution with path alias support
- **Migration Files**: Stored in `/migrations/` directory, auto-numbered (001_, 002_, etc.)
- **Workflow**:
  1. Create migration: `npm run migrate:create add_new_column`
  2. Edit generated file in `/migrations/` to implement `up()` and `down()` functions
  3. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
  4. Update types: `npm run db:codegen`
- **Scripts**:
  - `scripts/create-migration.ts` - Auto-generates numbered migration files
  - `src/database/migrator.ts` - Executes pending migrations
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always implement both `up()` and `down()` for reversibility
  - One schema change per migration file
  - Test on development data before production
  - Regenerate types after applying migrations

### Component Organization
- Feature-based component structure
- Separation between display components and business logic
- Context hooks provide clean data access patterns

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
- Database connection settings for PostgreSQL
- JWT secrets for authentication
- Next.js configuration variables

### Docker Development
- PostgreSQL runs on port 5434 (not default 5432)
- Adminer database management on port 5433
- Requires `hm_network` Docker network

## Testing
- Vitest with jsdom environment
- @testing-library/react for component testing
- Tests must pass before production builds
- Current coverage is limited - expand testing for new features

## QR Code Match Integration

### Overview
The application supports QR code generation for match management, allowing third-party apps to scan codes and submit match results externally.

### Key Components
- **QRMatchCode**: React component for generating and displaying QR codes
- **QRMatchModal**: Modal interface for creating QR matches
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/qr-match/generate` (create), `/api/qr-match/submit` (results)
- **Data Flow**: Generate match ID → Store match metadata → Third-party submission → Update match results

### QR Code Data Structure
```typescript
interface QRMatchData {
  matchId: string;           // Unique identifier
  player1: string;           // First player name
  player2: string;           // Second player name
  tournamentId: number;      // Tournament reference
  round: number;             // Current round
  submitUrl: string;         // API endpoint for results
}
```

### CORS Configuration
The QR match submission endpoint supports cross-origin requests with environment-based configuration:
- **Development**: Allows all domains (`*`) for testing
- **Production**: Uses `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable (single domain only)
- **Implementation**: `src/app/api/qr-match/submit/route.ts` includes `getCorsHeaders()` function and OPTIONS handler
- **Headers**: Supports POST/OPTIONS methods with Content-Type and Authorization headers
- **Limitations**: Only single origin supported; wildcard patterns not supported due to CORS spec

### Usage
1. Click "Generate QR Match" button in tournament interface
2. Select two players for the match
3. QR code generated with match metadata
4. Third-party app scans code and submits results to API
5. Match results automatically update in tournament system

## Build Process
- Tests run automatically before builds (`npm run build`)
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS processing with autoprefixer
- Production builds include internationalization optimization
- **Migrations run automatically after build** via `postbuild` script (Vercel deployment)

### Vercel Deployment
- Environment variables (`POSTGRES_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`) must be set in Vercel dashboard
- Migrations run automatically after successful build via `postbuild` hook
- No `.env` file needed - uses Vercel environment variables
